Yes, we are building PetroBot on GitHub. PetroBot Technologies is a deep technology startup that uses indigenously designed and manufactured robots for non-destructive testing inspection solutions. 

We are building a systematic framework that allows for the replacement of manual inspection with robotic technology, without breaking the bank. 

Say goodbye to human error and hello to increased accuracy, speed, and safety. If you’re interested in joining their team, you can contact them at info@petrobot.co.in.
